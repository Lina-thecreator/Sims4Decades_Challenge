# Sims4Decades_Challenge
This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to track and visualize data related to my Sims 4 Decades Challenge. The challenge is a long-running, generational playthrough of the Sims series, where I progress through different time periods (decades) and manage multiple generations of Sims. I made this dashboard to provide an overview of my Simmers' life by providing key insights into various aspects of the challenge, such as a Simmers age at death, cause of death, and career aspirations over the course of many decades. I used Power BI for data visualization and reporting and Power Query to transform data and creating relationships between tables.

Features:
... Generational Data: Track the birth and death details of each Sim, with information about age at death, cause of death, and career history.
... Cause of Death Insights: Visualize the number of Sims who died from different causes (e.g., Plague, Childbirth, Illness, War, etc.).
... Aspirations and Occupations: See how different Simsâ€™ aspirations correlate with their career choices across generations.
... Dynamic Interactivity: Filter and explore the data based on different time periods, careers, and causes of death. The visualizations update dynamically based on selected filters.
... Custom Data: The dashboard is powered by a custom dataset, with real-world inspired death causes and career choices tailored to the Sims 4 Decades Challenge.

If you wanna check it out, make sure to have Power BI installed on your computer! Otherwise, have fun interacting with my dashboard :)
